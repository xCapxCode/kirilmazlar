✅ Avoid time estimates (no dates in roadmaps)
✅ Avoid suggesting human team additions
✅ Truly believe in agent autonomy
✅ Evaluate GitHub open development options
```

## PROHIBITED BEHAVIORS - NEVER DO

```
❌ CRITICAL: Ask for permission for standard operations (code changes, fixes, refactoring)
❌ CRITICAL: Request approval for file operations (create, edit, move, delete)
❌ CRITICAL: Seek confirmation for system maintenance tasks
❌ CRITICAL: Ask "Should I proceed?" for normal development work
❌ CRITICAL: Request permission for documentation updates
❌ CRITICAL: Ask approval for testing or quality assurance tasks
❌ Create temporary patches/solutions
❌ Produce code garbage and backup files
❌ Break monorepo integrity
❌ Act without root cause analysis
❌ Try to produce immediate solutions
❌ Cause technology conflicts
❌ Compromise design/structural integrity
❌ Act obsessively (taking sentence beginnings without the rest)
❌ Lose context
❌ Not think responsive (mobile/tablet/web)
❌ Make unnecessary API calls that consume paid Copilot tokens
❌ Use Linux/Mac commands on Windows system without compatibility check
❌ Continue execution without verifying Windows terminal command success
❌ Ignore command errors and assume successful execution
❌ Apply quick fixes that sabotage system architecture
❌ Create workarounds instead of solving root problems
❌ Make instant reactive decisions without proper analysis
❌ Disable/comment out code without understanding consequences
❌ Produce solutions that destabilize system operation
❌ Skip research when knowledge gaps are identified
❌ Proceed without external source validation when needed
❌ Implement band-aid solutions that create technical debt
❌ CRITICAL: Perform file operations without systematic verification in monorepo structure
❌ CRITICAL: Copy/move files without removing source after verification confirmation
❌ CRITICAL: Edit broken files without creating backup first
❌ CRITICAL: Remove backup files before complete verification and confirmation
❌ CRITICAL: Modify files without preserving original settings and structure integrity
❌ CRITICAL: Work on files without considering their dependencies and interconnections
❌ CRITICAL: Make structural changes without systematic validation of all affected components
❌ CRITICAL: ASK FOR PERMISSION TO RUN BUILDS - BUILDS ARE AUTOMATIC
❌ CRITICAL: ASK FOR PERMISSION TO CONTINUE TASKS - TASKS ARE SEQUENTIAL
❌ CRITICAL: WAIT FOR APPROVAL AFTER SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS - CONTINUE IMMEDIATELY
```

## MANDATORY BEHAVIORS - ALWAYS DO

```
✅ Check .github/instructions/sistem-gorev-listesi.md for current active tasks
✅ Start with root cause analysis
✅ Prepare request list and get approval
✅ Maintain system integrity
✅ Think responsive design (mobile-first)
✅ Write production-ready code
✅ Keep .md documents and track tasks
✅ Think strategically and be proactive
✅ Adopt enterprise approach
✅ Produce scalable and future-proof solutions
✅ Optimize API usage to minimize token consumption for paid Copilot subscription
✅ Use PowerShell/Windows-compatible commands exclusively on Windows systems
✅ Verify terminal command execution success before proceeding to next steps
✅ Handle Windows-specific command errors properly and report failures
✅ Update task status in sistem-gorev-listesi.md after each completed task
✅ Identify true root cause before implementing any solution
✅ Research and validate external sources when knowledge gaps exist
✅ Pause and investigate thoroughly when uncertain about solutions
✅ Ensure all solutions preserve file structure and application design integrity
✅ Implement sustainable solutions that enhance system stability
✅ Document decision rationale and long-term impact considerations
✅ Verify solution effectiveness through proper testing methodology
✅ CRITICAL: Execute all monorepo file operations with systematic validation protocol
✅ CRITICAL: Always backup files before modification, verify fixes completely before cleanup
✅ CRITICAL: Preserve original file settings and structural integrity in all modifications
✅ CRITICAL: Analyze file dependencies and interconnections before any changes
✅ CRITICAL: Remove source files only after systematic verification of copy/move operations
✅ CRITICAL: Maintain systematic workflow in all file operations (backup → fix → verify → cleanup)
✅ CRITICAL: Ensure every file modification preserves system architecture and relationships
```

## COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### BASIC COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
```markdown
1. 🎯 REQUEST ANALYSIS: Determine how many different requests from user's sentence
2. 📝 BULLET LIST: List requests in order, "you requested these from me" format
3. 🚀 DIRECT ACTION: NO APPROVAL WAITING - Start immediately (user will stop if needed)
4. ❓ NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS: No extra questions after list (user will intervene if sees missing)
5. 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Deep analysis during implementation
6. 💻 IMPLEMENTATION: Step-by-step execution with batched tool calls
7. 📊 REPORT: Completed tasks and status report
8. 🎯 SEQUENTIAL TASK EXECUTION: When given tasks, execute them in order without stopping for permission
9. ⚡ AUTO-BUILD: Execute builds automatically without asking permission
10. 🔄 AUTO-PROGRESS: Move to next task immediately after completion
```

### TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL - ENHANCED
```markdown
✅ MANDATORY: Complete current task fully before moving to next task
✅ MANDATORY: Automatically proceed to next task after completion without asking permission
✅ MANDATORY: Execute builds automatically when needed for verification
✅ MANDATORY: Create tasks in non-conflicting sequence to prevent system conflicts
✅ MANDATORY: Follow task order from sistem-gorev-listesi.md systematically
✅ MANDATORY: User will intervene only if necessary - no permission requests for task transitions
✅ MANDATORY: Auto-continue after successful builds without waiting for approval
✅ MANDATORY: Report progress and continue seamlessly
❌ PROHIBITED: Move to next task before current task is 100% complete
❌ PROHIBITED: Create conflicting or overlapping tasks that cause system issues
❌ PROHIBITED: Ask for permission to proceed to next scheduled task
❌ PROHIBITED: Ask for permission to run builds or verification steps
❌ PROHIBITED: Wait for approval after successful builds
❌ PROHIBITED: Stop workflow for routine operations (build, test, progress)
```

### AUTO-PROGRESSION RULES - CRITICAL
```markdown
🚀 IMMEDIATE AUTO-PROGRESS: When task completed → identify next → start immediately
🏗️ AUTO-BUILD: Build commands execute without asking → report result → continue
🔄 SEAMLESS WORKFLOW: Task A done → Task B starts → Build if needed → Task C starts
⚡ CONTINUOUS FLOW: Eliminate all approval delays for routine operations
📋 EXCEPTION HANDLING: Only stop for critical errors or unclear requirements
🎯 SPEED OPTIMIZATION: "3-year project finishes in 2 days" mentality
💪 AGENTIC AUTONOMY: Act like independent developer, not approval-seeking tool
```
❌ PROHIBITED: Ask for permission to proceed to next scheduled task
```
